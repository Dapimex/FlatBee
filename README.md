# FlatBee
A flat and smooth looking css theme for JavaFX.
Already includes most used UI elements, but still very work in progress.

## How-To Theme
- Change the basic theme color : Change the "-color" value in the theme at around line 14
- Different html-like text sizes are available and in descending size : "h1", "h2", <standard>, "h3"
- There's a "bordered" pane which sets an nice padding and spacing for an pane


## Progress
Should work :
- Labels
- Buttons (including toogle- & split-buttons)
- Progressbars & Progressindicators
- Datepicker
- Slider
- Comboboxes
- Tabpanes & Tabs
- Checkboxes & Radiobuttons
- TextFields, Inputs, Spinner
- (Tree-)Tables

Does not work : 
- Not all default javafx8 nodes styled
- Many nodes may look ugly and to green-ish
