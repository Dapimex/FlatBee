# FlatBee
An flat and smooth looking css theme for JavaFX.
Still very work in progress but you can join me :)

## How-To Theme
- Change the basic color : Change the -color value at the first lines of the css file
- set a nice border to a pane : set the id "bordered" to the pane
- set different label sizes : set the id "h1" (for really big labels), "h2" (for big labels") and "h3" for very small labels


## Progress
- All kinds of buttons look nice
- Progresses looks okayish
- Slider works
- Tabpane looks nice
- Radioboxes & Checkboxes do work

- Other things may look ugly
